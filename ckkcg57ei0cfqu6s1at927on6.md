## Why learn Python in 2021?

If you are planning to learn to code & enter the **DEVCommunity** then I suggest you go with **Python.**

Python is the best programming language to start your programming journey.

In this article, I will tell you "Why Python is best?"

First of all
 
## What is Python?

Python is a high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. It is an interpreted language which supports different programming paradigms. is simple and easy to learn, read and write with a large community and extensive libraries.

## Why Python?

- ** Simple & Easy **

Python is not only easy to learn but also easy to use and implement. Allowing us to concentrate on the solution rather than the language itself. With a syntax similar to English, you can master the syntax of Python coding in a few days.

Python has a gentler learning curve (compared to languages like C, C++, Java, etc.) due
to its simple syntax.
Python code appears like pseudo-code.
Its high-level built-in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it simple to work with.

- ** Free and Open Source **

You don’t need to pay charges to install and use Python.
Also, the source code of Python is freely available to the public and you can also change it and distribute it. This allows the Python community to improve its features continuously.

- **High-level Programming Language**

Python is a programming language with strong abstraction from the details of the underlying
platform or the machine.
We don’t have to bother about low-level details like memory allocation. This makes python user-friendly.

- **Dynamically Typed**

Types of variables, objects, etc. in Python are generally inferred during runtime and not statically assigned/declared as in most of the other compiled languages such as C or Fortran.
All these operations happen while the program is interpreted.

- **Portable/Platform Independent**

Python is portable and highly flexible. It gives support across multiple platforms. Python codes can be ported between Windows, Linux and Mac OS. Python eliminates the need to write different code for different machines and OS.

- **Garbage Collection**

Python takes care of memory allocation and deallocation on its own. you don't have to worry or deal with the memory management and garbage collection.

 - **Interpreted**

Python first converts the source code into byte code and then translates this into the native language of the underlying machine. Python executes it line by line.
This makes it easier to debug a Python code because you can do it while writing the code

- **Multiparadigm**

Python supports various programming and implementation paradigms, such as:

1. Object-Oriented programming

2. Functional programming

3. Procedural programming

4. imperative programming

Python makes all four available and working for different use cases.

- **Extensible & Embeddable**

Python is an extensible language, meaning that it can be extended to other languages.
Python code can invoke C/C++ code/libraries, it can be called from C++ and integrated with Java, Arduino or .NET components to give it scripting capabilities.

- **Large Standard Library**

The Python Standard Library is huge and it offers a wide range of facilities such as providing access to system functionality such as I/O operations as well as provides standardized solutions for many problems that occur in
everyday programming.

So these are some of the most noteworthy features of Python that make it an excellent programming language to choose to start with.

## What are the applications of Python?

Python is the most prefered language according to 
**StackOverflow**
which means a majority of developers use Python.

So what makes Python so popular among the developer community?

It's because of its **real-world application** in verity of fields.

- **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**

AI/ML are undoubtedly among the hottest topics of this decade. Their applications require a language that is stable, secure, flexible and is equipped with tools that can handle the various unique requirements of projects.

Python’s stability, security, simplicity, consistency, platform independence, great collection of resourceful libraries, and an active community make it the perfect tool for developing AI and ML applications. Python facilitates some of the most popular AI/ML libraries.

- **Web Development**

Python comes with an array of frameworks (Flask, Django etc.) and CMS (Django CMS, Wagtail etc.)
Python also has out-of-the-box support for various web protocols.
Python’s Package Index comes with useful libraries like Requests, BeautifulSoup etc.

- **Game Development**

Python comes equipped with a host of tools and libraries for game development. Some of the 2D and 3D game development libraries that make this possible are PyGame, PySoy, PyOpenGL. Python is the foundation for games like Battlefield 2, Frets on Fire

- **Scientific and Numeric Applications**

Python has become a crucial tool in scientific and numeric computing. In fact, Python provides the skeleton for applications that deal with computation and scientific data processing. Apps like FreeCAD & Abaqus are coded in Python.

- **Desktop GUI**

Python’s comprehensible syntax and its modular architecture are feature key to creating super fast and responsive GUI while making the entire development process a breeze.
Python offers many GUI toolkits and frameworks that make a desktop application.

- **Software Development**

Python offers a host of features, such as quick execution, high compatibility, strong community support, and an enormous collection of libraries which aim to simplify the process of software development. That is why Software Developers use Python.

- **Image Processing**

Python also finds a unique use case in image processing and graphic design applications. Python is used globally to design and build 2D imaging software like Inkscape, GIMP. Also, Python is used in several 3D animation packages such as Blender, Maya.

- **Web Scraping Applications**

Python is a tool for extracting voluminous amounts of data from websites and web pages. With Python’s simple code, building and using Web Scrapers becomes a lot easier. Python libraries for Web Scraping are Request, BeautifulSoup, Selenium.

- **Business Applications**

Python high performance, scalability, flexibility, and readability are just the features required for developing fully-functional and efficient business applications.

Odoo and Tryton are other python tools for business applications development.

- **Embedded Applications**

By far one of the most fascinating applications of Python is the ability to run on embedded hardware. Popular examples of these applications include MicroPython, Zerynth, PyMite, and EmbeddedPython.

- **Data Science **

Data Science involves data collection, data processing, data exploration, data analysis, and data visualization.
The Python offers several libraries that can help you tackle your Data Science problems head-on. (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)


After looking at all there diverse real-world applications of Python, it's quite clear that python is capable of handling almost any development requirement.

And this is what makes python the Most preferred language for all developers.


Hope this helps you to get started with python.
