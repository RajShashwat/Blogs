## Why learn Python in 2021? (Features of Python)

If you are planning to learn to code & enter the **DEVCommunity** then I suggest you go with **Python.**

Python is the best programming language to start your programming journey.

In this article, I will tell you "Why Python is best?"

First of all
 
## What is Python?

Python is a high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. It is an interpreted language which supports different programming paradigms. is simple and easy to learn, read and write with a large community and extensive libraries.

## Why Python?

- ** Simple & Easy **

Python is not only easy to learn but also easy to use and implement. Allowing us to concentrate on the solution rather than the language itself. With a syntax similar to English, you can master the syntax of Python coding in a few days.

Python has a gentler learning curve (compared to languages like C, C++, Java, etc.) due
to its simple syntax.
Python code appears like pseudo-code.
Its high-level built-in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it simple to work with.

- ** Free and Open Source **

You don’t need to pay charges to install and use Python.
Also, the source code of Python is freely available to the public and you can also change it and distribute it. This allows the Python community to improve its features continuously.

- **High-level Programming Language**

Python is a programming language with strong abstraction from the details of the underlying
platform or the machine.
We don’t have to bother about low-level details like memory allocation. This makes python user-friendly.

- **Dynamically Typed**

Types of variables, objects, etc. in Python are generally inferred during runtime and not statically assigned/declared as in most of the other compiled languages such as C or Fortran.
All these operations happen while the program is interpreted.

- **Portable/Platform Independent**

Python is portable and highly flexible. It gives support across multiple platforms. Python codes can be ported between Windows, Linux and Mac OS. Python eliminates the need to write different code for different machines and OS.

- **Garbage Collection**

Python takes care of memory allocation and deallocation on its own. you don't have to worry or deal with the memory management and garbage collection.

 - **Interpreted**

Python first converts the source code into byte code and then translates this into the native language of the underlying machine. Python executes it line by line.
This makes it easier to debug a Python code because you can do it while writing the code

- **Multiparadigm**

Python supports various programming and implementation paradigms, such as:

1. Object-Oriented programming

2. Functional programming

3. Procedural programming

4. imperative programming

Python makes all four available and working for different use cases.

- **Extensible & Embeddable**

Python is an extensible language, meaning that it can be extended to other languages.
Python code can invoke C/C++ code/libraries, it can be called from C++ and integrated with Java, Arduino or .NET components to give it scripting capabilities.

- **Large Standard Library**

The Python Standard Library is huge and it offers a wide range of facilities such as providing access to system functionality such as I/O operations as well as provides standardized solutions for many problems that occur in
everyday programming.

So these are some of the most noteworthy features of Python that make it an excellent programming language to choose to start with.

Hope this helps you to get started with python.
